<h1>Key Editor</h1>
<p>
    After clicking the key the editor switched to key editing mode.<br>
    Each key has a set of assigned commands.<br>
    For the list of commands see the Commands menu.

<p>
    Note: You can have multiple key editor tabs open at the same time.<br>
    The top bar of the center panel is a list of tabs of the active editors. The first one is always the profile editor.
</p>
<h3>Command Format</h3>
<p>
    The format is very simple. Each line in the editor should contain 1 correctly formatted command call.<br>
    Each line should look like this: [namespace].[function]([parameters])<br>
    You can see the list of available namespaces on the left panel. Open down the 'Mouse' namespace and double click on the 'moveAbs' label.<br>
    A line like this has appeared in the editor:
</p>
<p class = "code-example">Mouse.moveAbs(x = ?, y = ?)</p>
<p>
    This inserted line contains the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The namespace is 'Mouse'</li>
    <li>The function is 'moveAbs'</li>
    <li>2 parameters: 'x' and 'y' both with the value '?'</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This command is not yet walid, because the 'x' and 'y' parameters are supposed to be integers, not question marks.<br>
    Let's change those question marks to integers, like this:
</p>
<p class = "code-example">Mouse.moveAbs(x = <span class = "integer-param">50</span>, y = <span class = "integer-param">50</span>)</p>
<p>
    This line is now a valid command.<br>
    To save a key right click on the key's tab and hit 'Close'

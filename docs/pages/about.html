<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    Keyboard Binder is an application that allows the handling of multiple keyboards separate from each other.<br>
    It allows binding scripts to the keyboard's buttons. It also allows blocking keyboard input per keyboard.<br>
    <br>
    Keyboard Binder comes with a bunch of builtin functionality for things like simulating mouse/keyboard interactions or interacting with applications like Premiere Pro or OBS.

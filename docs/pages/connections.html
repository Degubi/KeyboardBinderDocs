<h1>Remote Connections</h1>
<p>
    There are some modules that require that the application is connected to some other application or is logged into some service
</p>
<br>
<h2>OBS</h2>
<p>
    OBS functionality is implemented through the OBS Websocket plugin. First make sure it is enabled in OBS settings.<br>
    To enable it tick the 'Enable Websocket server' option. It is also recommended to 'Enable System Tray Alerts' so that you know if you can actually connect to it.

    Next steps are to connect to OBS from the application:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Open up 'Connections' from the tray icon menu</li>
    <li>Click on the 'Toggle OBS' option</li>
    <li>If you enabled the 'Enable System Tray Alerts' in OBS settings a notification should pop up regarding a successful connection</li>
    <li>After this point all functions that are found in the OBS module should work</li>
</ul>

<h1>Editor & Extension Setup</h1>
<p>
    In Keyboard Binder everything is written as Python scripts.<br>
    It is recommended to use an editor like <a href = "https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> for a better scripting experience.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Starting Keyboard Binder</h2>
<p>
    Start Keyboard Binder if you haven't already. On the first start it will handle some setup stuff.<br>
    After completing the setup it will run in the background. To know if it is running you can check the application's green keyboard tray icon: <img width = "24" src = "assets/favicon.ico" style = "top: 4px; position:relative"><br><br>
    <br>
    Before starting using keyboards it might be useful to run code without all of the keyboard hassle.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Visual Studio Code Support</h2>
<p>
    It is possible to run code in Keyboard Binder from VSCode using an extension:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Install the Python extension from the extension store</li>
    <li>Install the KeyboardBinder-Debugger extension from the KeyboardBinder application folder (In VSCode 'Install from VSIX' and browse for the 'KeyboardBinder-Debugger.vsix' file)</li>
    <li>Change the language to Python in the bottom right corner</li>
    <li>TODO: Finish debugger tutorial</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Note: Keyboard Binder has very good support for Python typings.<br>
    Because of this it is also recommended to setup type checking inside the editor for convenience & avoiding some common errors.

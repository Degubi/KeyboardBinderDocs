<h1>Editor & Extension Setup</h1>
<p>
    In Keyboard Binder everything is written as Python scripts.<br>
    It is recommended to use an editor like <a href = "https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> for a better scripting experience.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Visual Studio Code Support</h2>
<p>
    It is possible to run code in Keyboard Binder without the keyboard hassle from VSCode using an extension:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Install the Python extension from the extension store</li>
    <li>Install the KeyboardBinder-Debugger extension from the KeyboardBinder application folder (In VSCode 'Install from VSIX' and browse for the 'KeyboardBinder-Debugger.vsix' file)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Note: The Keyboard Binder modules have very good support for Python typings.<br>
    Because of this it is also recommended to setup type checking inside the editor for convenience & avoiding some common errors.

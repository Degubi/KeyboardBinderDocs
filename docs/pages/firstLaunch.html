<h1>First Launch</h1>
<p>
    Upon the first launch of the application you'll be asked to create a new profile.<br>
    A profile's parameters are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A user defined name</li>
    <li>A user picked keyboard</li>
    <li>A user picked key that activates the profile ranging from F1 to F11</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This means that there can be multiple profiles created, which means that there can be multiple profiles active at the same time assigned to different keyboards.<br>
    The profile input dialog looks like this:

    Note: This dialog only auto appears on launch when there are no profiles stored.<br>
    To manage profiles right click on the application's tray menu icon.

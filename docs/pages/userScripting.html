<h1>User Scripting</h1>
<p>
    To start scripting naviage to a profile's script folder. It is recommended use an editor like VSCode for a better scripting experience.<br>
    <br>
    It is also recommended to setup type checking inside the editor for convenience & avoiding some common errors.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Script File Structure</h2>
<p>
    User scripts are written as regular python scripts.<br>
    There are a number of provided modules for interacting with the user's mouse/keyboard or other supported applications.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Simple Script Example</h2>
<p>
    Let's start by creating a very simple script for e.g the 'A' key. To begin create a file named 'A.py' (in the profile's folder).<br>
    Paste in the following code:
</p>
<p class = "code-example">
    <span style="color: var(--keyword-color)">from</span>
    <span style="color: var(--module-name-color)">keyboardBinder</span>
    <span style="color: var(--keyword-color)">import</span>
    <span style="color: var(--module-name-color)">Mouse</span><br><br>

    <span style="color: var(--module-name-color)">Mouse</span>.<span style="color: var(--function-name-color)">move_cursor_to</span>(x = <span style="color: var(--number-literal-color)">50</span>, y = <span style="color: var(--number-literal-color)">50</span>)
</p>
<p>
    The first line imports the Mouse module from the keyboardBinder's library. We use this module to interact with the user's mouse.<br>
    The second line moves the cursor to the given location on the screen. (the top left corner of the screen is considered 0 0)<br>
    For all the supported modules & functions check the 'Scripting Modules' section.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Running</h2>
<p>
    Running a script is really easy:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Activate the profile with it's activation button on it's keyboard</li>
    <li>Press the 'A' key on the profile's keyboard</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>__events__.py</h2>
<p>
    This script file contains functions that get called on different lifecycle events of the profile.<br>
    These functions can be used to e.g connect to other applications or to setup input blocking, or to do clean up.<br>

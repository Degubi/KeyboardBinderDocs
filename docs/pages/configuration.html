<h2>Keyboards</h2>
<p>
    First we need to add the keyboard(s) that we intend to use for scripting
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Select the 'Keyboards' tab on the top</li>
    <li>Enter the name that you intend to use for the keyboard</li>
    <li>Select a physical keyboard by following the instructions on the screen after clicking on the 'Pick Physical Keyboard' button</li>
</ul>
<h2>Profiles</h2>
<p>
    After adding a keyboard the next step is to create a profile
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Select 'Profiles' tab on the top</li>
    <li>Fill out the profile's parameters:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Keyboard</li>
        <li>Activation key ranging from F1 to F11</li>
        <li>An optional application where the keyboard's input gets blocked (blocking normal input, running only scripts)</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>
    Profiles are stored in the application's 'scripts' folder, in this folder each subfolder represents a profile.

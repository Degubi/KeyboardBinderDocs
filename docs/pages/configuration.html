<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
    To configure the application use the desktop tray icon:
</p>
<img src = "assets/configuration/trayIcon.jpg" style = "margin-right: 30px;">
<p>
    From this menu you can add keyboards, profiles, manage connections or close the application.<br>
    The architecture of the application is based around profiles.<br>
    A profile's parameters are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A user defined name</li>
    <li>A user picked keyboard key that activates the profile ranging from F1 to F11</li>
    <li>A user picked keyboard</li>
    <li>An optional application where the input gets blocked on the selected keyboard (blocking normal input, running only scripts)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Profiles are stored in the application's 'scripts' folder, in this folder each subfolder represents a profile.

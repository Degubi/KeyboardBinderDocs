<h1>OBS Integration</h1>
<p>OBS integration is implemented through the <a href = "https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-websocket-remote-control-obs-studio-using-websockets.466/">OBS Websocket</a> plugin (this is available by default since v28)</p>
<br>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>In OBS go to Tools/obs-websocket Settings</li>
        <li>Tick the 'Enable Websocket server' option</li>
    </ul>
    Note: It is also recommended to 'Enable System Tray Alerts' so that you know if Keyboard Binder can actually connect to it.

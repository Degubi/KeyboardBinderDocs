<h1>OBS Integration</h1>
<p>
    OBS functionality is implemented through the OBS Websocket plugin. First make sure it is enabled in OBS settings.<br>
    To enable it tick the 'Enable Websocket server' option. It is also recommended to 'Enable System Tray Alerts' so that you know if you can actually connect to it.

</p>
<ul>
    <li>Open up 'Connections' from the tray icon menu</li>
    <li>Click on the 'Toggle OBS' option</li>
    <li>If you enabled the 'Enable System Tray Alerts' in OBS settings a notification should pop up regarding a successful connection</li>
    <li>After this point all functions that are found in the OBS module should work</li>
</ul>

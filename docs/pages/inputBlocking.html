<h1>Keyboard Input Blocking</h1>
<p>
    It can be useful to block the normal keyboard inputs when pressing keys that run scripts.<br>
    Keyboard Binder uses selective input blocking, which means you have to manually block keyboard inputs in processes.<br>
    <br>
    The reasoning for this is that some similar programs that use automatic input blocking causes most games to get the user banned because of the nature of keyboard input blocking.<br>
    This of course implies that blocking keyboard input in games is a bad idea because of the high chance of getting banned!
</p>

<h2>Blocking</h2>
<p>
    To start blocking an application's keyboard input use the 'block_process_keyboard_input' function found in the 'Application' module, like so:
</p>
<p class = "code-example"><span style = "color: var(--module-name-color)">Application</span>.<span style = "color: var(--function-name-color)">block_process_keyboard_input</span>(<span style="color: var(--string-literal-color)">'Adobe Premiere Pro.exe'</span>)</p>
<p>
    This code blocks the keyboard input in Premiere Pro. The keyboard which input gets blocked is the current profile's keyboard.<br><br>
    Note: you have to call this function once per session, so calling it on profile activation is a perfect place.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Unblocking</h2>
<p>
    Unblocking is done automatically when the profile gets disabled, or when Keyboard Binder closes.

<h2>Keyboards</h2>
<p>
    First we need to add the keyboard(s) that we intend to use for scripting:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Select the 'Keyboards' tab on the top</li>
    <li>Enter the keyboard's name</li>
    <li>Select a physical keyboard by following the instructions on the screen after clicking on the 'Pick Physical Keyboard' button</li>
    <li>Click the 'Add' button on the right side</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Profiles</h2>
<p>
    After adding a keyboard the next step is to create a profile:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Select 'Profiles' tab on the top</li>
    <li>Enter the profile's name</li>
    <li>Select a keyboard</li>
    <li>Pick an activation key ranging from F1 to F11</li>
    <li>Click the 'Create' button on the right side</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Scripts Folder</h2>
<p>
    Profiles are stored in the application's 'scripts' folder, in this folder each subfolder represents a profile.<br>
    There's also a special script file that gets created upon profile creation called '__events__.py'.<br>
    This script file contains functions that get called on different lifecycle events of the profile.<br>
    For example 'on_activate' gets called when the given profile gets activated.<br>
    These functions can be used to e.g connect to other applications or to setup input blocking, or to do clean up.
